I am Abu Hunzla, a dedicated professional with a strong background in data science and software development. Over the past five years, I have honed my skills in various technologies, including Python, Docker, Kafka, and SQL Server. My journey in the tech world has been marked by a relentless pursuit of knowledge and excellence, which has allowed me to contribute significantly to multiple projects, particularly in the fields of AI and data analytics. One of my notable projects is the development of a facial attendance system for Android, where I applied advanced machine learning algorithms like XGBoost to create a small, efficient, offline application.

In addition to my technical prowess, I have a keen interest in addressing bias in data science algorithms. I believe that responsible AI development involves not just creating efficient models but also ensuring they are fair and unbiased. This belief drives my work, inspiring me to develop strategies and tools that mitigate bias in data analysis and machine learning processes. My commitment to ethical AI development has been a cornerstone of my career, influencing my approach to both research and practical applications.

Outside of my professional life, I am a lifelong learner with a passion for continuous improvement. I enjoy staying updated with the latest advancements in technology and frequently engage in activities that challenge my problem-solving skills. Whether it's through exploring new programming languages, attending tech conferences, or collaborating with peers on innovative projects, I am always looking for opportunities to grow and make a positive impact in the tech community. My approach to both life and work is characterized by a blend of curiosity, determination, and a deep-seated passion for technology.
